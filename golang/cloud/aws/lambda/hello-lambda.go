/* //// DEPLOYMENT STEPS ////
0. build for linux and zip the executable
	- GOOS=linux go build -o lamda
1. login to aws
2. from IAM roles page: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/roles
	- "create role" button
	- "AWS Service" as type
	- for "Choose the service that will use this role" choose "Lambda". then clock Next.
	- on permissions page, make sure to add "CloudWatchLogsReadOnlyAccess" permission
	- on Review page, name the role, and then create the role.
	- Note: this role will be used by the below steps while creating the lamda function
3. go to lamda functions page: https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home
	- click on "Create function" button
	- Choose "Author from scratch" template
	- fill the fields.
		-- choose Golang runtime
		-- for Role, choose the existing role, created as part of the previous steps
	- click "Create Function" button. you have technically created the lamda function, you now need to configure it)
4. configure the lamda function
	- under "Function code" section:
		-- choose the "Upload a .zip file" type
		-- choose Go runtime
		-- for "Handler" field, type the name of the executable in the zip file uploaded
		-- using "Upload" button, upload the binary zip file generated in previous steps.
	- using "Designer" section,
		-- add "API Gateway" trigger,
		-- configure it:
			--- choose "Create a new API"
			--- choose the desired security. for testing you can choose "Open" security
			--- click "Add"
	- "save" changes
5. Test
	- find the endpoint/api trigger url
	- using your favorite rest client, hit the api endpoint
	- make sure to pass the json of id, value (see go code)
		{
		"id": 1,
		"value": "test1"
		}
	- TODO: tested from asw sucessfully, but need to test gtom rest client
*/

/* //// POSSIBLE ERRORS ////
here are some possible errors, that i have seen

// when uploading the binary in aws console, if the name mentioned in the "Handler" is not same as that of binary built (in the zip file being uploaded)
{
  "errorMessage": "fork/exec /var/task/lambda: no such file or directory",
  "errorType": "PathError"
}
// same error as above is possible when the uploaded zip file has a folder within
// when not build for linux. if NOT done like this GOOS=linux go build
{
       "errorMessage":"fork/exec /var/task/lambda: exec format error",
       "errorType":"PathError"
}
// when used by the API-gateway to trigger, and the response is not in the required format. ref https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/malformed-502-api-gateway/
	Execution failed due to configuration error: Malformed Lambda proxy response
