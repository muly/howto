demonstrating generating go server code (without main) using go-swagger

Note: once the code is generated, the main function and the handlers implementation is hand coded.

swagger code gen server steps:
1) swagger specs
    see: swagger.yml
2) generate code:
    see: Makefile
3) main code:
    see: main.go
4) create object and add implementation for the handlers:
    see: ./api/handlers/*.go
